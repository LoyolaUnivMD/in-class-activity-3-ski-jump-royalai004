4. If hill is "normal"
  a. Set height to 46
  b. Set pointsPerMeter to 2
  c. Set par to 90
5. Otherwise
  a. Set height to 70
  b. Set pointsPerMeter to 1.8
  c. Set par to 120
6. Set time to sqrt((2 * height)/9.8)
7. Set distance to (speed * time)
8. Set points to (60 + (distance - par) * pointsPerMeter)
9. If points >= 61
  a. Output "Great job for doing better than par!"
10. Otherwise if points < 10
  a. Output "What happened?"
11. Otherwise
  a. Output "Sorry, you didn't go very far."
